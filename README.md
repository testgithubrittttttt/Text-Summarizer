# Text-Summarizer

## Overview
The Text Summarizer project aims to develop a powerful and efficient tool for generating concise summaries from large bodies of text. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system offers both extractive and abstractive summarization capabilities. The goal is to assist users in quickly understanding the key points from extensive documents, articles, or any text data, making it particularly useful for research, news analysis, and educational purposes.

## Features
1. Extractive Summarization: Identifies and extracts the most important sentences from the text to create a summary.
2. Abstractive Summarization: Generates a new summary that paraphrases and condenses the text while retaining the core message.
3. Multi-lingual Support: Capable of summarizing text in multiple languages.
4. User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive user interface for easy input and output management.
5. Real-Time Processing: Fast and efficient summarization for immediate results.

## Technology Stack
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries & Frameworks:
   - Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
   - Transformers (Hugging Face)
   - TensorFlow/Keras
   - BeautifulSoup
3. Deployment: Flask/Django for the web application, Docker for containerization

## Installation
Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)
